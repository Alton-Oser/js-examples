				<h3>Functions listenFunction and deafFunction</h3>
				<p>The first one is to demonstrate the use of an event listener in js.  Click on the button to the right and it will provide a message due to the eventlistener.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-offset-1 col-xs-5 text-center">
				<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" id="eventButton">I'm Listening</button>
				<p>As you can see, the eventlistener based on the button's id displayed a message.  It also called another function that stopped the button from listening to anymore clicks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-xs-5 text-center">
				<h3>Functions reverseFunction and showHidden</h3>
				<p>Ok, so now that we have that in place, lets move on to something else.  You will input a word, phrase or sentence and then click the button beside it.  When you click the button, the word, phrase or sentence you typed in will be displayed in reverse order.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-offset-1 col-xs-5 text-center">
				<div id="inputDiv">
					<input type = "text" id = "yourInput">
					<button class="btn btn-danger" id = "reverseButton">Reverse it!</button>

				<p id = "hiddenParagraph">Pretty cool, huh?  Notice, we also with javascript created a new element to be added to the body of the webpage.</p>

			<h3>Function palindrome</h3>
				<p>Let's make a test to test for palindromes.  What the heck is a palindrome?  Well, it's a word or phrase that spelled backwards is spelled the same way it is normally spelled.  For example, the word <span>deed</span> is a palindrome.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-offset-1 col-xs-5 text-center">
				<div id="inputDiv">
					<input type = "text" id = "yourPalindrome">
					<button class="btn btn-info"  id = "palindromeButton">Check for palindrome</button>
				</div>
				<p  class = "pali" id = "palindromeMsg0">You did not enter anything.  Please type something.</p>
				<p class = "pali" id = "palindromeMsg1">SUCCESS!  This is indeed a palindrome!  Good job!</p>
				<p class = "pali" id = "palindromeMsg2">Sorry.  This is not a palindrome.  Better luck next time.</p>

# js-examples
This is just a personal project I decided to do.  The HTML file gives a brief description of the function on the left and then on the right is the interactive example of the function being used.  I started making the output be differenct colors, fonts, etc but near the end, I just focused on how the functions are used and not so much on the styling. 

All of the functions are called using the addEventListener with both click and keyup when the enter key is pressed.  Feel free to use any of these functions and let me know if you have any questions.
